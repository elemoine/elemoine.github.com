</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I joined Camptocamp in 2007. There I quickly became a core developer and
project member of <a class="reference external" href="http://openlayers.org">OpenLayers</a>. I also became a lead
developer of Camptocamp's «&nbsp;Geospatial Python team&nbsp;». I learned a lot.
I learned about the Geospatial field, open-source communities, Python
programming, JavaScript programming, web development, web architectures.
The list is not exhaustive.</p>
<p>One thing that I love about Camptocamp is that Camptocamp do production. They
do consulting. They do development. But they also operate machines and run code
in production. For that the dev teams work together with ops teams, and this
greatly contributed to making my job very interesting.  I had the chance to
regularly exchange with ops people, with a common overall objective to build
applications that actually deploy and run in production.</p>
<p>This is also what made me want to change job. My collaboration with
Camptocamp's ops team exposed me to things like Puppet, Docker, OpenStack, and
building scalable, resilient and monitored applications. I wanted to know more
about all this. I wanted to go deeper with all that, to really understand what
this means and where this is all going.</p>
<p>So here I am, working in the Logging, Monitoring and Alerting team at Mirantis.
I just finished my third week, so the whole business is still very very new to
me.  But I feel that I've already learned quite a lot; things that I understood
but were a bit abstract are now getting more palpable. The mission of my team
is to build an end-to-end monitoring solution for OpenStack that can scale
to thousands of nodes. I think it's a great mission! We use great technologies
like Heka, Kafka and influxDB to accomplish our mission.</p>
<p>My current specific tasks involve making our Puppet manifests more generic,
making it possible to deploy our monitoring solution outside the <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel">Fuel</a> OpenStack deployment tool, and on any
OpenStack distribution. Eventually, we will also look at other deployment
tools, but this is matter for future work. We also have many other things in
mind for future releases, that I hope I could talk about here in this blog.</p>

documentation, but uses shortcuts, and relies on <tt class="docutils literal">virtualenv</tt> as much as
