</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Three weeks ago I was in Austin (Texas, USA) for the &quot;Newton&quot; OpenStack summit.
&quot;Newton&quot; is the name of the next OpenStack release, whose projected release
date is October 2016. This was my very first OpenStack summit, so I thought it
would be worth writing a few words about it.</p>
<p>An OpenStack summit is actually mutiple events: the main conference, the ops
summit and the design summit. The ops summit consists of sessions where people
share their experience (good or bad) about deploying and operating OpenStack.
The design summit consists of sessions where people (mostly) OpenStack
developers discuss new features and issues to be addressed in the coming
OpenStack release. Both the ops and design are rather informal and
self-organized. <a class="reference external" href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/newton-design-summit-101">Design Summit 101</a> provides a good
overview on how design sessions work. One thing that I've liked a lot is the
use of an Etherpad document during a session. The session lead displays the
Etherpad on the projector screen, and people in the room write comments and
questions while other people speak. This gives everyone a chance to give
opinions and ask questions.</p>
<p>The OpenStack world being new to me, I was in discovery mode, and did a bit of
everything. I listened to a couple talks from the main conference, and attended
a number of the ops and design summits. In particular I participated to <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Design_Summit/Newton/Etherpads#Kolla">Kolla
sessions</a>, Kolla
being a project I had a chance to contribute to. Talking about Kolla I also
gave a talk together with Alicja Kwaśniewska and Michał Jastrzębski about the
Logging system we implemented in Kolla (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.openstack.org/videos/video/these-arent-the-logs-youre-looking-for">video</a>).</p>
<p>Overall, it was an interesting experience. I learned quite a lot about
OpenStack. I also learned about all things I don't know and I need to learn.
OpenStack is a vast world. And it is not only OpenStack. Containers, Docker,
Kubernetes are things you could hear at every corner during the summit. The
most frustrating part for me probably was that I was for the most part
a spectator of the design summit. If I have a chance to go to another summit
in the future I hope I'll be able to act more as a contributor.</p>
