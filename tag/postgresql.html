</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I just attended a 3-day training on PostgreSQL&nbsp;Administration. The training was given by Thibaud
Walkowiak, from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dalibo.com">Dalibo</a>. I've been using PostgreSQL for years, mainly for
GIS-related stuff with PostGIS. And I wanted to know more about its internals and
administration. This training's been an excellent opportunity for that!</p>
<p>The training covered a lot of topics. My favorite were PostgreSQL's Journaling system, PITR
(Point-In-Time Recovery) system, and MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) implementation. I like
systems (in the broad sense), and these topics are very much system-oriented. Along the way, I've
also learned a few psql tricks, plus system extensions, views and functions that can be very useful
for diagnosing and troubleshooting problems.</p>
<p>In this blog post I am going to summarize on the things I learned about Journaling, PITR, and MVCC,
providing links to doc pages and articles I've found useful and interesting as I tried to gather
more information and understanding on these exciting topics.</p>
<div class="section" id="journaling">
<h2>Journaling</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL's Journaling system, a.k.a. WAL (Write-Ahead Logging), is what guarantees the integrity
of the data, the durability of operations, while enabling high peformance to database users.</p>
<p>This is how I'd summarize the functioning of Journaling in a few sentences: on a transaction commit
data changes are recorded into the journal, and the data itself is written into PostgreSQL's memory
(in the <em>shared buffers</em>) without actually being flushed to disk. The flushing of &quot;dirty&quot; buffers is
done at a later time by PostgreSQL&nbsp;system processes, namely the Background Writer and the
Checkpointer (explaining the differences between the two is beyond the scope of this post). Now, in
the event of a crash, the database can be recovered by replaying the operations recorded in the
journal.</p>
<p>What's really really cool is that WAL is the basis for other cool features such as on-line backup,
point-in-time recovery and replication! The Postgres project is indeed really good at building
things in a gradual manner, with the low-level stuff being built first, and providing the foundation
for higher-level features.</p>
<p>With the hands-on exercises I discovered the <tt class="docutils literal">pg_buffercache</tt> extension. This extension allows
getting information about all the blocks of the PostgreSQL&nbsp;instance's <em>shared buffers</em> memory. It
tells about what objects use the blocks, what blocks are dirty, etc. For example here's a query
that returns the 5 objects that use the most memory:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
SELECT c.relname,
           c.relkind,
           count(*) AS buffers,
           pg_size_pretty(count(*)*8192) as mem_size
FROM   pg_buffercache b
INNER JOIN pg_class c
          ON b.relfilenode = pg_relation_filenode(c.oid)
                AND b.reldatabase IN (0, (SELECT oid FROM pg_database
                                                                  WHERE datname = current_database()))
GROUP BY c.relname, c.relkind
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 5 ;
</pre>

<div class="section" id="point-in-time-recovery">
<h2>Point-In-Time Recovery</h2>
<p>PITR is a way to back up PostgreSQL&nbsp;databases. As opposed to traditional backup strategies based on
<tt class="docutils literal">pg_dump</tt> or similar the backup process is done continuously, greatly narrowing the data loss
window. PITR also operates without shutting down the PostgreSQL&nbsp;instance, and with close to zero
impact on the database users.</p>
<p>PITR is based on the journaling system. The journals are archived in a safe location, and in the
event of a bad operation or a data loss on the PostgreSQL&nbsp;system the data can be recovered by
replaying the journal operations on top of a previous image of the data files. The recovery
can be done up to a certain point in time, hence the name PITR.</p>
<p>PITR involves two operations: the archiving of WAL files, and the copying of the data files for the
creation of &quot;images&quot; onto which journal operations can be replayed. For the archiving of WAL files
one can rely on the <tt class="docutils literal">archive_command</tt> (push model) or on the <tt class="docutils literal">pg_receivewal</tt> command (pull
model). For the copying of the data files there's also two options. One can rely on the
<tt class="docutils literal">pg_start_backup</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">pg_stop_backup</tt> functions, and use her own tool for the actual
copying of the data files. Or the <tt class="docutils literal">pg_basebackup</tt> tool can be used.</p>
<p>I see PITR as very good way to achieve backups, when minimizing the data loss window is a key
element. Using PITR is certainly more involved than just using <tt class="docutils literal">pg_dump</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">pg_restore</tt>, but
setting it up is not that complex really. Plus there are good tools such <em>Barman</em>, <em>pitrery</em>, and
<em>pgBackRest</em> that simplify and streamline the PITR process. I'd definitely consider those tools
next time I need to set up PostgreSQL database backups.</p>

<div class="section" id="mvcc">
<h2>MVCC</h2>
<p>MVCC means « Multi-Version Concurrency Control&nbsp;». It is the model used by PostgreSQL for
handling data changes and transactions.</p>
<p>Basically, in a PostgreSQL table, a record can be stored in multiple versions. A change to an
existing record leads to the creation of a new version of that record. Similarly the deletion of
a record leads to the creation of a new version of the record. With this mechanism transactions can
see different versions of records, which is precisely what transactions are about.</p>
<p>Related to MVCC&nbsp;and the transaction isolation levels are the <tt class="docutils literal">xmin</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">xmax</tt> system columns.
For example, let's assume you have a table named <tt class="docutils literal">t</tt> with columns <tt class="docutils literal">c1</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">c2</tt>. In addition
to <tt class="docutils literal">c1</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">c2</tt> you can select the <tt class="docutils literal">xmin</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">xmax</tt> columns. For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# select xmin, xmax, * from t;
 xmin | xmax | c1 | c2
------+------+----+---
 1105 |    0 | 1  |  1
 1105 |    0 | 2  |  2
 1105 |    0 | 3  |  3
(3 rows)
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">xmin</tt> is the id of the transaction that created the record. <tt class="docutils literal">xmax</tt> is the id of the transaction
that deleted the record. For example if a transaction is being deleting a record you will see this
in another transaction:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# select xmin, xmax, * from t;
 xmin | xmax | c1 | c2
------+------+----+----
 1105 | 1106 |  1 |  1
 1105 |    0 |  2 |  2
 1105 |    0 |  3 |  3
(3 rows)
</pre>
<p>Here are two rules that always apply:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Records with <tt class="docutils literal">xmin</tt> smaller than the id of the current transaction are visible to the
current transaction if the <tt class="docutils literal">xmin</tt> transaction was committed.</li>
<li>Records with <tt class="docutils literal">xmax</tt> smaller that the id of the current transaction are not visible to
the current transaction if the <tt class="docutils literal">xmax</tt> transaction was committed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other cases depend on the isolation level used in the transactions.</p>
<p>Another thing closely related to MVCC is <tt class="docutils literal">VACUUM</tt>. MVCC and the creation of new record versions
imply that mechanisms exist to clean up &quot;dead&quot; records. A record is dead if it has a <tt class="docutils literal">xmax</tt> that
corresponds to a transaction that was committed or rolled back, and that there's no ongoing
transaction using that record. In old versions of PostgreSQL&nbsp;the administrator was responsible
for setting up periodic VACUUM jobs. The PostgreSQL&nbsp;versions that everyone uses nowadays include
an <tt class="docutils literal">autovacuum</tt> process that takes care of these periodic VACUUM operations.</p>

<h2>Some conclusion</h2>
<p>The notes in this blog post just touches the surface of the topics discussed. They also certainly
take shortcuts. What I love about PostgreSQL&nbsp;is its transparency. In particular the excellent
documentation is very transparent on the way PostgreSQL works internally. For example the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pgpointcloud/pointcloud">Pointcloud extension</a> I work on defines types that
support the <tt class="docutils literal">TOAST</tt> interface, and I've found <a class="reference external" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/storage-toast.html">the TOAST doc</a> very clear and informative!</p>
<p>Keep up the good work PostgreSQL! We love you!</p>
